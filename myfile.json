    "description": "Welcome to Logistic Regression in R for Public Health Why logistic regression for public health rather than just logistic regression? Well there are some particular considerations for every data set and public health data sets have particular features that need special attention. In a word they are messy. Like the others in the series this is a hands on course giving you plenty of practice with R on real-life messy data with predicting who has diabetes from a set of patient characteristics as the worked example for this course. Additionally the interpretation of the outputs from the regression model can differ depending on the perspective that you take, and public health doesnot just take the perspective of an individual patient but must also consider the population angle. That said much of what is covered in this course is true for logistic regression when applied to any data set so you will be able to apply the principles of this course to logistic regression more broadly too. By the end of this course you will be able to explain when it is valid to use logistic regression and define odds and odds ratios and run simple and multiple logistic regression analyses in R and interpret the output ",
